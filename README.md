It uses modern technologies like computer vision and face_recognition to extract details of suspicious entities. It also takes into account geocoding API in order to extract the live location of CCTV IP address, firebase, and cloud API's to upload and retrieve images related to suspicious activity snapshotted from live CCTV footage. Google Gmail API and Vonage API handle email and SMS services respectively.
